Get rid of player controlled characters being a special class. Add a function
to Creature that overrides their think method, so that Creatures can be
dynamically become player controlled/non-player controlled (backup original
think method).

Actually consider line-of-sight when attacking (possible to hit targets the
user was not aiming at).

Better hit/miss messages (attributes?).

Add in letting players choose to throw or melee weapons (e.g., throw rock
versus bash with rock).

Guns should support ammo (and keep track of ammo used).

Add support for scrolling through status lines.

Move some code from Player.py to Creature.py, and integrate a simple AI that
uses the InputHandler class. End result: players 'see' actions of enemies as if
enemies are controlled by a local keyboard.

Lighting Sources have a z-position (e.g., on ground, a bit above ground, high
above ground etc.) and this affects which cells they light up - ray tracing
