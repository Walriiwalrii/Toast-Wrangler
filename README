Toast Wrangler is a turn-based strategy/tactical RPG. It uses only curses
graphics and has a wild west theme. There is/will be a heavy emphasis on line of
sight and lighting.

This game will require a UTF-8 capable terminal. I use gnome-terminal, in
Ubuntu 11.04.

See tutorial.txt for keyboard control help.

A quick how-to-play-guide:
    
This game is not complete. But, here's what you can do:

    python __main__.py

Then, know that you control a team of 2 character. You first move one character
(optionally attacking), then the next, then the first again, and so on. Use the
arrow keys to move the current player. The number of 'move points' left for that
character is displayed in the lower right corner. When it reaches 0, the
character may not move (but may attack if he/she has not yet done so). If a
character can perform no more actions, you will automatically be switched to
controlling the next character.

There is/will be a heavy emphasis on line-of-sight. The default view is to show
no more or no less than what the current player can see. This is known as
'individual view,' because it is the view of the individual character. Press TAB
to switch back and forth between individual view and 'team view.' Team view
shows anything that any player-controlled characters can see.

For example, if your first character is behind a tree, he or she cannot see past
the tree. There might be deadly outlaws on the other side of the tree!  However,
if another player-controlled character is past the tree, and team view is on,
then the player (probably) can see what danger lurks around the tree.  Team view
let's you more easily coordinate the actions of characters, without exposing
yourself to danger or wasting move points peeking around corners.

When making decisions about who to attack*, be sure to use individual view.
After all, if the current character cannot properly see the target, even if
another teammate can, then the current character cannot attack the target*.

*This is a lie. Line of sight is not yet tested.

Lighting is also very important, as the game takes place entirely at night.
Each character carries a lantern with him or her (this may be changed later).
This let's the character see the area around him/her. Press 'l' to toggle the
lantern being on or off. Clearly lit areas are bright in color. Poorly lit
areas are duller in color. 

Some things in the world naturally let out light. Currently, campfires emit a
small light that illuminates nearby items/creatures/ground.
